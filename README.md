**The card game of war itself is NOT fun, unless you play with kids and cheat to lose ASAP ;)**
However, "war" proved quite interesting as my first excercise in OOP in Python. My code uses several classes such as Card, Deck, Player. Two instances of the Player class play out a game, using an instance of the Deck class. You don't need to do anything, it will play out itself, giving you the overall length of the game (the number of comparisons).
**I will add new features, such as playing out *N* games in a row and providing more stats (e.g. mean and std of game length over *N* games)**
